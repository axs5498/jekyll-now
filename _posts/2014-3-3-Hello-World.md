This is ashok. 

My aspiration is to become a great researcher. 

I am interested in understanding the role of technologies in energy and environmental challenges. I study this area through the lens of time use, life cycle assessment, and cost benefit analysis. 

i also love to think about philosophy and religion. 

My favorite anime is one piece, and zoro is my favorite character!
