Hi! This is Ashok. I live in Austin. 

My aspiration is to become a great researcher.

I am interested in understanding the role of technologies in energy and environmental challenges. I study this area through the lens of time use, life cycle assessment, and cost benefit analysis.

i also love to think about philosophy and religion.

### More Information

I love to run, hike, and play field hockey. 

My favorite anime is one piece!
